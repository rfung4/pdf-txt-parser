SUMMARY

Q1 2020 was the first time in our history that we achieved a positive
GAAP net income in the seasonally weak first quarter. Despite global
operational challenges, we were able to achieve our best first quarter for
both production and deliveries.

Although impacted by inefficiencies related to the temporary suspension
of production and deliveries in many locations, our gross margin
remained strong. At Gigafactory Shanghai, further volume growth
resulted in a material improvement in margins of locally made Model 3
vehicles. In addition, Model Y contributed profits, which is the first time
in our history that a new product has been profitable in its first quarter.

Despite the expiration of various government incentives at the end of
last year, Ql was pacing to be the strongest quarter of deliveries until
our operations were interrupted in March. As a result, we remain
confident in growing global production capacity as quickly as possible.
We are continuing to significantly invest in our product roadmap,
including improvements in technology, as well as localizing production
In Shanghai and Berlin.

At the same time, we are diligently managing working capital, reducing
non-critical soend, and driving productivity improvements. We believe
we are well-positioned to manage near-term uncertainty while achieving
our long-term plans.
